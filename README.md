# Project is dead

Folks, this is the end of YugoAuto. It didn't last long but it was fun. Often small fish like me can't fight against big
corporations like BlaBlaCar.

I had the best of intentions, but without a large marketing budget this was going nowhere. People will still use
Facebook groups and BlaBlaCar. That's perfectly fine. Statistics on YugoAuto are quite bad and people use YugoAuto very
little.

With that, I decided to shut down YugoAuto. People will be ok if they have to pay a booking fee. It was great for me, I
learned a lot and I'm glad I offered something for free.

Kisses to everyone ;)
